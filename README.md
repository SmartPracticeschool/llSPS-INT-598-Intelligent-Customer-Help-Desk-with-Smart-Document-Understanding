Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
A Intelligent Chatbot consiting of Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery integrated on Node-Red Webpage In this code pattern, we walk you through a working example of a web app that utilizes multiple Watson services to create a better customer care experience.

Using the Watson Discovery Smart Document Understanding (SDU) feature, we will enhance the Discovery model so that queries will be better focused to only search the most relevant information found in a typical owner's manual.

Using Watson Assistant, we will use a standard customer care dialog to handle a typical conversation between a custmomer and a company representitive. When a customer question involves operation of a product, the Assistant dialog will communicate with the Discovery service using a webhook.

The webhook will be created by defining a web action using IBM Cloud Functions.
